WELCOME TO SHOH'S FLASHCARD APP USING PYTHON WITH TKINTER AND PANDAS # Project-Portfolio

Project overview:
Please try out the code and use the application to test out my flaschards for practicing Russian!
This is an improved flashcard application that has a 3 second timer for each word, in order to test your thinking and improve your speaking skills!
For words that you cannot memorize or do not get right, it will continue running until you have memorized all of them!

Developer's Comments: 
If there any errors, including logical or syntax errors you come across, please please LEAVE a comment! It will help me a lot!

Switching to a different language: 
If you want to change the language, search up "{Language that you want} CSV file" onto your search engine
Then, download the CSV file and add it your PyCharm/VS Code project. Make sure the title of your CSV matches the one inside the code before you run
Otherwise, the code will not work! I recommend to get the CSV files from GitHub, there are some great ones out there.
